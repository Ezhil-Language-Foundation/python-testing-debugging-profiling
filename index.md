title: Testing, debugging, and profiling
---

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> This lesson covers testing, debugging and optimization of Python code.
> If you have basic knowledge of Python and numpy (mostly used for
> illustrating examples), then you are ready to go.
>
> If you have already written a test suite, used a symbolic debugger and
> profiled your Python code to find performance bottlenecks, then this
> lesson is probably too basic for you.

> ## Getting ready {.getready}
>
> This lesson is based on Python 3 and numpy, and uses tools such as ipython (or the jupyter notebook) and pynest. If you have a standard installation of Anaconda, then you have all you need.
